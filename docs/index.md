## What is Polaris?

!!! info "Our vision"

    Polaris aims to **foster the development of impactful AI models in drug discovery** by establishing a new 
    and adaptive standard for measuring progress of computational tools in drug discovery.

Polaris is a suite of tools to implement, host and run benchmarks in computational drug discovery. Existing benchmarks leave several key challenges - related to the characteristics of datasets in drug discovery - unaddressed. This can lead to a situation in which newly proposed models do not perform as well _as advertised_ in real drug discovery programs, ultimately risking misalignment between the scientists developing the models and downstream users. With Polaris, we aim to further close that gap. 

### Polaris Hub
A quick word on the [Polaris Hub](https://polarishub.io/). The hub hosts a variety of high-quality benchmarks and datasets. While the hub is built to easily integrate with the Polaris library, you can use them independently.
