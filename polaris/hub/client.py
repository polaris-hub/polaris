class PolarisHubClient(OAuth2Client):
    """
    A client for the Polaris Hub API. The Polaris Hub is a central repository of datasets, benchmarks and results.
    Visit it here: [https://polarishub.io/](https://polarishub.io/).

    Bases the [`authlib` client](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/api.html#authlib.integrations.httpx_client.OAuth2Client),
    which in turns bases the [`httpx` client](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#client-instances).
    See the relevant docs to learn more about how to use these clients outside of the integration with the Polaris Hub.

    Note: Closing the client
        The client should be closed after all requests have been made. For convenience, you can also use the
        client as a context manager to automatically close the client when the context is exited. Note that once
        the client has been closed, it cannot be used anymore.

        ```python
        # Make sure to close the client once finished
        client = PolarisHubClient()
        client.get(...)
        client.close()

        # Or use the client as a context manager
        with PolarisHubClient() as client:
            client.get(...)
        ```

    Info: Async Client
        `authlib` also supports an [async client](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/httpx.html#async-oauth-2-0).
        Since we don't expect to make multiple requests to the Hub in parallel
        and due to the added complexity stemming from using the Python asyncio API,
        we are sticking to the sync client - at least for now.
